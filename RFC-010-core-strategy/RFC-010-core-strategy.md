# RFC010 - Core Strategy

## Proposed by

Felicity Brand, Carrie Crowe

## Current status

See the status indicated on the pull request description.


## Proposal overview

This RFC is to gain consensus on several key areas of The Good Docs Project as it stands in 2022. This touches on our vision, audience, content and how we deliver value. 
The information is contained in the Core Strategy document (core-strategy.md).

The Core Strategy document seeks to outline the fundamentals of the project, answering the following questions:

* What is The Good Docs Project?
* What do we do?
* Who is our audience?
* What content do we offer?

This can then drive our content strategy, and work will follow in future RFCs to answer deeper questions about content substance, workflow, structure and governance.


## Motivation

There are several benefits to articulating where we are, how we can best support our users and community members, and where we’d like to grow in future.

Documenting our core strategy means that:

**As a project**, we can: 

* Have a touchstone or “North Star” to guide decisions about content produced by the project, as well as communications about the project.
* Reinforce the foundation that is already underlying our current initiatives.
* Adapt easily to support our audience. As we grow, our audience will grow and their needs might change. 

**As a community**, we can:

* Hold a shared idea of what we’re about—so that we’re on the same page. 
* Present a unified idea, and use consistent language, when talking about the identity of our project to others.

**As content producers**, we can: 

* Address content challenges, prioritize them accordingly and form solutions. 
* Tie each piece of content that we create back to a community or project goal. 


## Proposal

That we accept the following related file:

* core-strategy.md


## Consequences

An agreed core strategy will help all members of our community, and end users, understand what the project is doing. This will impact the words 
on our website, how we meet the needs of our users and how we document our own project.

The project will evolve over time, and the core strategy statement in this RFC is not intended to be future-proof. We should revisit the core 
strategy and vision statement at regular intervals—this might be annually, or if we happen to have a major shift in focus or experience unexpected growth.


## Links and prior art

{This section is optional if you want to [link](https://example.com) to other resources.}


## Open questions

{This section is optional and is where you can list questions that won't be resolved by this RFC, including those raised in comments from community members.}


## Decisions deferred

What’s not covered is the deeper dive into the various pillars of content strategy such as content substance, workflow, structure and governance. 
These pillars answer questions like:

* What are our content types?
* Who produces and maintains our content?
* On what channels and platforms does the content live?
* How do our users access the content?
* When and how is content reviewed, evaluated and archived?

This work is intended to follow as future deliverables from the Content Strategy working group.
