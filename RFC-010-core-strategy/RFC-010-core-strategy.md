# RFC010 - Core Strategy

## Proposed by

Felicity Brand, Carrie Crowe

## Current status

See the status indicated on the pull request description.


## Proposal overview

This RFC is to gain consensus on several key areas of The Good Docs Project as it stands in 2022. This touches on our vision, audience, content and how we deliver value. 
The information is contained in the Core Strategy document (core-strategy.md).

The Core Strategy document seeks to outline the fundamentals of the project, answering the following questions:

* What is The Good Docs Project?
* What do we do?
* Who is our audience?
* What content do we offer?

This can then drive our content strategy, and work will follow in future RFCs to answer deeper questions about content substance, workflow, structure and governance.


## Motivation

There are several benefits to articulating where we are, how we can best support our users and community members, and where we’d like to grow in future.

Documenting our core strategy means that:

**As a project**, we can: 

* Have a touchstone or “North Star” to guide decisions about content produced by the project, as well as communications about the project.
* Reinforce the foundation that is already underlying our current initiatives.
* Adapt easily to support our audience. As we grow, our audience will grow and their needs might change. 

**As a community**, we can:

* Hold a shared idea of what we’re about—so that we’re on the same page. 
* Present a unified idea, and use consistent language, when talking about the identity of our project to others.

**As content producers**, we can: 

* Address content challenges, prioritize them accordingly and form solutions. 
* Tie each piece of content that we create back to a community or project goal. 


## Proposal

That we accept the following related file:

* core-strategy.md


## Consequences

An agreed core strategy will help all members of our community, and end users, understand what the project is doing. This will impact the words 
on our website, how we meet the needs of our users and how we document our own project.

The project will evolve over time, and the core strategy statement in this RFC is not intended to be future-proof. We should revisit the core 
strategy and vision statement at regular intervals—this might be annually, or if we happen to have a major shift in focus or experience unexpected growth.


## Links and prior art

{This section is optional if you want to [link](https://example.com) to other resources.}


## Open questions

{This section is optional and is where you can list questions that won't be resolved by this RFC, including those raised in comments from community members.}


## Decisions deferred

What’s not covered is the deeper dive into the various pillars of content strategy such as content substance, workflow, structure and governance. 
These pillars answer questions like:

* What are our content types?
* Who produces and maintains our content?
* On what channels and platforms does the content live?
* How do our users access the content?
* When and how is content reviewed, evaluated and archived?

This work is intended to follow as future deliverables from the Content Strategy working group.


## Feedback

### Removing 'What we don't do'

I initially included a section articulating what we don't do, but after discussion, I removed it. It included three points:

* Host conferences.
* Charge for membership.
* Charge for templates.


Tina commented: If we want to be even clearer: what about meetups, local writing days, etc? Maybe we're not hosting full-blown conferences but it might 
be good to know if some smaller versions of a conf (like a meetup) will also be categorically excluded for some reasons (for example we don't want to 
fragment our community into groups of "seeing each other in person" and "contributing remote only".

Alyssa said: I agree with Tina that we might want to clarify. I had the same thought when I read that we don't do conferences. I'm not sure why that 
needs to be called out. Just to differentiate us from Write the Docs? I could see us holding large community events, although not conference-level large.
For example, I'm hoping to kick off an all day template project management docs jam in the summer where we encourage people to help us audit our existing
template issues, categorize what template packs we want to make, and write out issues for all the work we want to do. Is that a conference? No, but it's 
kind of a bigger event than just a meetup.

Ryan said: We might also title this something like "We we aren't trying to do or provide" as a way to highlight that even if we have things like write-ins, 
those are one-offs and not without the scope of the project. That said, this seems to escape the scope of "content strategy", doesn't it? It's about the 
structure above content: the organization. I recommend cutting this section. Even where true, they shouldn't be pinned to a content strategy doc as a source of truth.

Carrie said: After reading through it again, I agree with removing this section.


### Punchy tagline

Alyssa: I really do love this core strategy statement as-is and will be fine with adopting it as-is. But I will say that it doesn't make me pump my fist in the air and say, "YEAHHHHH! Let's do this!!!!" I maybe want some more inspirational stuff here for something that is going to be a core strategy.

Is there any way we can integrate docs advocacy into our core strategy? One of my past versions of a core strategy statement included a statement like, "The Good Docs Project advocates for the kind of high quality documentation we want to see in the world." I'm not in love with that, but it starts to hint at "we want to change the world" level inspiration.

Maybe if we also included a brief, punchy "why" statement? Like, "At the Good Docs Project, we believe that good documentation can make the world a better, more equitable place. Good docs make it easier for people from all backgrounds to onboard with the software and tools that can make their lives better or easier. Good docs make it easier for people to join and contribute to open source, making the world's technologies and open source communities a little bit richer, one project at a time."

Talking out loud, but maybe what I'm wanting in addition to the core strategy is a punchy, bumper-sticker like tagline or phrase that is catchy and meaningful. "Because good docs can change the world. Let us show you how." Kind of like how Write the Docs has "Docs or it didn't happen." Very memorable and intuitive.
