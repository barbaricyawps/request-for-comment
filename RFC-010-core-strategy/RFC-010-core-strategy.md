# RFC010 - Core Strategy

## Proposed by

Felicity Brand, Carrie Crowe

## Current status

See the status indicated on the pull request description.


## Proposal overview

This RFC is to gain consensus on several key areas of The Good Docs Project as it stands in 2022. This touches on our vision, audience, content and how we deliver value. 
The information is contained in the Core Strategy document (core-strategy.md).

The Core Strategy document seeks to outline the fundamentals of the project, answering the following questions:

* What is The Good Docs Project?
* What do we do?
* Who is our audience?
* What content do we offer?

This can then drive our content strategy, and work will follow in future RFCs to answer deeper questions about content substance, workflow, structure and governance.


## Motivation

There are several benefits to articulating where we are, how we can best support our users and community members, and where we’d like to grow in future.

Documenting our core strategy means that:

**As a project**, we can: 

* Have a touchstone or “North Star” to guide decisions about content produced by the project, as well as communications about the project.
* Reinforce the foundation that is already underlying our current initiatives.
* Adapt easily to support our audience. As we grow, our audience will grow and their needs might change. 

**As a community**, we can:

* Hold a shared idea of what we’re about—so that we’re on the same page. 
* Present a unified idea, and use consistent language, when talking about the identity of our project to others.

**As content producers**, we can: 

* Address content challenges, prioritize them accordingly and form solutions. 
* Tie each piece of content that we create back to a community or project goal. 


## Proposal

That we accept the following related file:

* core-strategy.md


## Consequences

An agreed core strategy will help all members of our community, and end users, understand what the project is doing. This will impact the words 
on our website, how we meet the needs of our users and how we document our own project.

The project will evolve over time, and the core strategy statement in this RFC is not intended to be future-proof. We should revisit the core 
strategy and vision statement at regular intervals—this might be annually, or if we happen to have a major shift in focus or experience unexpected growth.


## Links and prior art

{This section is optional if you want to [link](https://example.com) to other resources.}


## Open questions

Two areas that arose during review that we should revisit as a project:

* Creating a punchy tagline
* Articulating our audience

You can read comments about these in the Feedback section of this document.

## Decisions deferred

What’s not covered is the deeper dive into the various pillars of content strategy such as content substance, workflow, structure and governance. 
These pillars answer questions like:

* What are our content types?
* Who produces and maintains our content?
* On what channels and platforms does the content live?
* How do our users access the content?
* When and how is content reviewed, evaluated and archived?

This work is intended to follow as future deliverables from the Content Strategy working group, and will be incorporated into the Governance repo, and then our project docs and website, as appropriate. 


## Feedback

### Removing 'What we don't do'

I initially included a section articulating what we don't do, but after discussion, I removed it. It included three points:

* Host conferences.
* Charge for membership.
* Charge for templates.


Tina commented: If we want to be even clearer: what about meetups, local writing days, etc? Maybe we're not hosting full-blown conferences but it might 
be good to know if some smaller versions of a conf (like a meetup) will also be categorically excluded for some reasons (for example we don't want to 
fragment our community into groups of "seeing each other in person" and "contributing remote only".

Alyssa said: I agree with Tina that we might want to clarify. I had the same thought when I read that we don't do conferences. I'm not sure why that 
needs to be called out. Just to differentiate us from Write the Docs? I could see us holding large community events, although not conference-level large.
For example, I'm hoping to kick off an all day template project management docs jam in the summer where we encourage people to help us audit our existing
template issues, categorize what template packs we want to make, and write out issues for all the work we want to do. Is that a conference? No, but it's 
kind of a bigger event than just a meetup.

Ryan said: We might also title this something like "We we aren't trying to do or provide" as a way to highlight that even if we have things like write-ins, 
those are one-offs and not without the scope of the project. That said, this seems to escape the scope of "content strategy", doesn't it? It's about the 
structure above content: the organization. I recommend cutting this section. Even where true, they shouldn't be pinned to a content strategy doc as a source of truth.

Carrie said: After reading through it again, I agree with removing this section.

### Change "people" in the core strategy statement

Alyssa raised the idea of the world "people" in our core statement being quite broad. I'm leaving the "people" for now. I think there is room to articulate the specificity of our audience somewhere. Let's iterate. Whether we incorporate it into our statement, or put it into the 'Audience' section. Do we have a primary and secondary audience? Is it important to capture that in our statement? Good, big questions that can be discussed. Here is the feedback from the RFC:

Alyssa: The first quibble is with saying that our target audience is "people." I'm of two minds about it. On the one hand, I like saying "people" because it it is generic and broad. That helps us to indicate that we want to be very inclusive and that we are seeking to empower a wide audience.

On the other hand, there's part of me that would like some specificity around who our primary and secondary audience is. In my mind (and I'm open to having my mind changed), I have felt that our primary audience is specifically non-technical writers, such as developers. And our secondary audience is technical writers.

The reason why that distinction matters to me is because it changes who our project is for. I personally think we want to be advocates for documentation well beyond the technical writing profession. I think we will naturally attract technical writers to our project and they will always find value in what we produce. But for me, that's tangential. I'm glad they will benefit from anything we produce, but personally I'm not making these resources for them.

The audience I'm interested in is non-technical writers, such as developers. The audience I'm interested in is people who are just beginning to see the value of good documentation and want to get better at it, but they don't know where to start of they don't feel like they are "good at writing." This audience wants to create good documentation, but they just don't know how and they need resources to help make it easier to produce better docs.

I love technical writers, don't get me wrong. But I want to be more than just a fun club for writers. I want to reach higher than that. And for that reason, I think there is value in explicitly calling out that we are reaching out to developers and other non-technical writers. Because, as Erin McKean said in the presentation about Good Docs Project that sold me on joining the project: “Docs advocacy is the developer-focused practice of encouraging better software documentationーwhether through creating good docs yourself, helping others produce docs, or by creating a culture that enables good docs to be produced.” In that same presentation, Erin has clarified that the reason docs advocacy is developer-focused (not technical writer focused) is because, frankly, there’s a lot of stuff in the world that needs documentation and there are not enough technical writers to do the documenting. We need to win more people over to our cause.

So, what would my edit be? Maybe to instead say "...educates and empowers developers and others working in a variety of roles to create high quality documentation..."

Ryan: My take on the core audience has some difference, but in nuance: it's for people who feel they need more help in writing, both developers who need to build skills and confidence, and with junior tech writers for the same reasons. Experienced tech writers will get something out of this stuff hopefully, sure, but they aren't the focus.

I say that so we can speak more to the experience level of the task at hand, not purely to the role we associate with that experience level.

That said, we should never lose our billing as "developer-focused" -- that's how we get devs here. But let's not discard those who need the same confidence, structure, and guidance that we associate with writing-minded devs.

Aaron: In the interest of supporting both Ryan's and Alyssa's first points, could we make a statement to say in general we want to support people who need help writing technical documentation, for example: technical writers, developers, open source contributors, etc., list a few?

Carrie: Thanks, Alyssa! I would also like to keep "developer-focused" in our statement. I think that is important to include. 

#### More thoughts on audience

Alyssa: Do we want to make a distinction between our audience and our community? Like our audience might be developers and our community might be more tech writers?

Ryan: That might get into roles and content types. I know there were some discussions when I was attending meetings about how some content may be internally for community members or aspirants (but still content on the website), so that's one user segment.


### Punchy tagline

Alyssa: I really do love this core strategy statement as-is and will be fine with adopting it as-is. But I will say that it doesn't make me pump my fist in the air and say, "YEAHHHHH! Let's do this!!!!" I maybe want some more inspirational stuff here for something that is going to be a core strategy.

Is there any way we can integrate docs advocacy into our core strategy? One of my past versions of a core strategy statement included a statement like, "The Good Docs Project advocates for the kind of high quality documentation we want to see in the world." I'm not in love with that, but it starts to hint at "we want to change the world" level inspiration.

Maybe if we also included a brief, punchy "why" statement? Like, "At the Good Docs Project, we believe that good documentation can make the world a better, more equitable place. Good docs make it easier for people from all backgrounds to onboard with the software and tools that can make their lives better or easier. Good docs make it easier for people to join and contribute to open source, making the world's technologies and open source communities a little bit richer, one project at a time."

Talking out loud, but maybe what I'm wanting in addition to the core strategy is a punchy, bumper-sticker like tagline or phrase that is catchy and meaningful. "Because good docs can change the world. Let us show you how." Kind of like how Write the Docs has "Docs or it didn't happen." Very memorable and intuitive.

### We do more than templates

Alyssa: I know you mentioned you aren't worried about making this document future proof, but I do worry that saying "we do templates" is boxing us in a little bit. I see us also making curriculum and simple guides (without templates) and other resources that can't be neatly classified. And some of these things we're already actively doing right now (like the Chronologue project where we're creating a model of good documentation, or the business case group that is creating an extensive guide for explaining why docs matter and should be given resources).

Ryan: +1. Something like "guides, blog posts, etc." would allow it flexibility.

I'd also maybe go with "Our primary product is our collection of templates," but that's also me pushing to delineate product material and production mechanisms with website material and publish mechanisms

Felicity: I've read and re-read the wording and I think that curriculum is covered by "docs education", guides without templates is covered by "content" and other resources is covered by "docs tooling" and "many other initiatives". I'd like to keep it helicopter-level for now.
I totally agree that we are more than templates. Perhaps something that might help is to remove the "first and foremost" wording. I'll leave it in just as a nod to how the project was first formed, way back in 2019.

### Publishing the core strategy

Carrie: When this document was originally created, Felicity and I had a discussion about this document as a whole living in the collected 'handbook' (alongside the other Content Strategy docs to come) which would likely be on the website.

There are contents of this document that I would like to see on the 'Learn More' page under 'About The Good Docs Project'. I think this would be a great place to have the Core Strategy Statement, as well as the Who we are, What we do section which could update the 'Goals of the Good Docs Project' section on our website.


### Notes about research

Cameron: "Research" is an overloaded term here. There is the trawling of existing templates of a certain type, and selecting the best. Then there is scientific research, analysing how people read and digest information - leading to recommended writing styles.

Alyssa:  don't think "research" must mean scientific research. Most of the time, it's not available, as Cameron has pointed out. (Academia is lagging behind the industry or where research exists, it's inaccessible behind a paywall.) However, I can say that, in general, nearly all of our template writers do conduct significant research into their content type when they create their templates. Many times template writers read 50-200 examples of the type of content they are creating a template for. In Community Docs, we've begun making it a standard process to create a gap analysis for the content type they're creating a template for. That's basically primary research (as opposed to secondary research, which is what consulting resources is).

Ryan: I tend to use "discovery" over "research", partly because there is a legal distinction, and partly because I spend time with UXRs and live with a researcher, and what I do in discovery barely counts. But that's me personally using my own idiolect to passively fight against our techbro culture of dismissing and minimizing research. So I guess I'd like to make sure whatever we do here elevates rather than conflates ideas.

But when I do see "backed by research" it does make me want to see the research papers we produce or reference to.


## Implementation checklist

If this proposal is accepted, the following tasks must be completed:

- [ ] Add the core-strategy.md document to the Governance repo
