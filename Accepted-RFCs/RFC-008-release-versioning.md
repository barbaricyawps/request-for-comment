# RFC008 - Release Versioning Strategy

See the status indicated on the pull request description.


## Proposal overview

As The Good Docs Project moves towards a formal release structure, this RFC proposes a standard versioning scheme to apply at least to the project's Product Outputs, as defined by outputs directly employed by users in their own documentation efforts. For example, this includes the collection of templates (which users copy as a starting point for their own documents).

TGDP will use the Semantic Versioning convention for the versioning of individual Product Outputs (as at November 2021, this includes the template collection and the DocTools website package).

> :triangular_flag_on_post: For the purposes of this RFC, "features" and "functionality" can refer to new **content**, such as additional sections or boilerplate text, added to doc templates.


## Motivation

Using the well-established [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) framework will provide the following benefits:

- It will demonstrate the project's progress to users and prospective users through publicly visible notifications.
- It will set expectations to current users regarding the extent of change(s) contained in a newly-release version of a Product Output, as compared to the version the user currently has, including potentially breaking backward-compatibility.
- It provides contributors to the project a common point of reference when collaborating, making the team more efficient.
- It provides downstream integrators of TGDP's Product Outputs an easy way to identify if their own work products will need to be updated to support new features, or if there is a risk of compatibility issues.


## Proposal

In the course of preparing for a Release from the project:

1. The PSC and Working Groups will decide on what functionality/features to target for it.
1. Working Groups will work towards these goals during regular working sessions.
1. Once the updates to a Product Output are **functionally complete**, meaning the initial implementation of new functionality has been completed, the Product Output can be tagged with a semantic target version number depending on changes introduced.
1. The first such tag within a Release cycle should also carry the "-alpha" suffix.
1. Further work during the release will focus on stabilizing the existing functionality and making it ready for general/production use.
1. Once the Product Output is deemed ready, it will be tagged with the same semantic version number and the "-beta" suffix.
1. At this point it should be released to a community of beta testers to actually use the Product Output. Feedback from this use should be actively solicited and captured.
1. Provided there are no "blocker"-level issues issues remaining with the Product Output as the Release's target date approaches, the Release Manager will coordinate the completion of any final updates before signaling for them to be tagged with the same semantic version number, minus any suffix (indicating a gamma/final release).
1. Once tagged, building and packaging the Product Outputs can commence.
2. Following the gamma release of an Output, "patch" releases may be released in parallel to updated versions, as described in the section Semantic versioning addendum for documents below.

## Semantic versioning addendum for documents

This document describes how MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH [*semantic versioning*](https://semver.org/) should be applied to documentation.

Source: [Semantic versioning addendum for documents. Version 0.1-alpha.4. January 2020](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPr_OHoUkg5Wjj3UWYX78ORtTBArSJck4mWrKhWpfPA).


### Introduction

The [*semantic versioning specification*](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) is widely applied to describe software release versions, however these SemVer rules don't align well with the characteristics of documentation. This addendum suggests rules which can be applied when versioning documents.


### SemVerDoc rules

The following table adds documentation-specific interpretations of the [*semantic versioning*](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver) rules. When applied to documentation, the SemVerDoc rules should take precedence over the equivalent software centric rules.


The remaining SemVer rules remain the same as their software equivalent.

### Applicability

Different documentation scenarios may apply the SemVerDoc rules differently.


### When to update the semantic version

The semantic version SHOULD only be updated when the software or document is baselined and shared. It doesn't need to be updated on every author commit during development.


### Auto-generated documentation from code

Some documentation is automatically generated from code comments, using tools such as javadoc. In such cases, documentation version numbers should match the code version numbers.


### Stand alone documents

Documents which logically should be tracked independently should follow the SemVerDoc standard, as stated.


### Documentation set

Often a set of documents are delivered as part of a milestone or release. In these cases, each document should maintain its own version
number, and then a separate version is assigned to all documents in aggregate.

This should be handled in a similar manner to a linux distribution. Linux distributions typically apply a time based milestone release, and each linux release includes multiple, independently versioned, software packages.


### Website

If a website, or a section of the website is versioned, then it should follow the same conventions as a documentation set.


### Internal codenames for releases

As discussed in the January 26, 2022 general US meeting where a quorum of project steering committee members were present, we will adopt internal codenames to refer to our template and tool releases.
We ran an internal community poll to determine what the naming convention should be and the decision was to name after notable bridges throughout the world.
Our codenames are alphabetical, which means that the first release will feature a bridge name that starts with the letter A.
For example: Accademia, Ada, Akashi, Akrobaten, Alamillio, Anzac.
The following release will have a bridge name that starts with the letter B and so forth.
Bridge names for each code release will be determined by the PSC or through informal community polls.

## Consequences

This decision will dictate how Releases are communicated to both internal and external parties. Using the Semantic Versioning convention will be familiar to many of the project's most important audiences, namely open source projects (many of which use the same or similar numbering schemes) and technical writers of various levels of experience.


## Dependencies

This RFC should be considered together with RFC-006, which describes the high-level planning process to be used for the project's Releases.

## Open questions

- Should we limit Product Outputs to one per Working Group? For example, the Community Docs Working Group would produce the "Template Collection," as opposed to considering each template as a separate Product Output?
  - In the context of this RFC, this means the collection as a whole would be versioned together.
  - A result of this would be that, as defined by the SemVer standard, **any** update to a template that adds materially to it (i.e. not fixing typos or other "bugs") would mean an increase in the minor version of the collection as a whole.
- How long will the project aim to support legacy major versions? Minor versions?
- Alyssa asks: Should we consider giving a name to our (for lack of a better term) core "product suite"? And by product suite I mean templates, tools, and Chronologue. We might want a name for the full core product and then for these subset projects underneath it. We'll also want to figure out how to tell the "story" we want to tell about the suite and the individual components to users. We also maybe need to think about how to talk about "collections" of templates. For example, "templates for open source projects" and "templates that every project will likely need" with the understanding that some templates will be in more than one collection. We still have a lot of thinking to do in the "product" space.
- Alyssa asks: I know that in the past I argued heavily for versioning the full collection of templates as a whole, but I'm beginning to change my mind on this after talking with people about the new direction for the easy button tools project. In separate conversations with Bryan and Derek where we were thinking more about the logistics of how the easy button would pull templates into the project for downstream consumption, we could think of some valid use cases where we'd need individual templates to be versioned. However, I consider this out of scope for this RFC right now because we need to do more development work on the easy button first.


## Decisions deferred

The following items are out of scope for this proposal, as they're either not integral to a Release Planning & Management plan, or are addressed by other (potentially upcoming) RFCs:

- Promotion/Marketing: This is a more holistic topic of who should drive promotion and marketing for the project. While Releases should certainly be part of this, the individual who takes on this role should drive the strategy behind communicating new and upcoming Releases to the community.


## Feedback

### Extending the release versioning

Cameron notes: For the content that is in this proposal section, I think it is a good foundation, and is pretty close to right.
I also think we should extend it to cover:

- From a general documentation point of view (say for docs which describe a product), what constitutes a sematic update based on major.minor.patch. What is:
  - A 1.0 release
  - A major update
  - A minor update
  - A patch update
- Same questions, but this time for our template.
- I think we should also discuss the difference between a document update, and a documentation set update. (Analogy is a package version vs a linux distribution version.)

Note that Cameron has also [drafted a proposal for how semantic versioning should apply to docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gPr_OHoUkg5Wjj3UWYX78ORtTBArSJck4mWrKhWpfPA/edit#).

## Implementation checklist

If this proposal is accepted, the following tasks must be completed:

- [ ] Approve RFC006
- [ ] Decide on the appropriate version for existing Product Outputs
- [ ] Conduct Planning for the initial project Release as described in RFC006
